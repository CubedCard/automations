# Automations

These are some automation files that are supposed to make my life a little easier.

There are also some random scripts that I wrote when I was bored.

For example the [pins game](./games/pins.py), a game I found on the [Bored Button website](https://boredbutton.com/),
where you need to guess the 4 digit pin code. I wrote a brute force script for this, just for fun! :)

<img src="games/img/guess the pin.png" alt="Guess the pin game result" style="width: 50%;" />

Furthermore, there are the [humanbenchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/) games, right [here](./games/humanbench), that I
try to automate using Python.
